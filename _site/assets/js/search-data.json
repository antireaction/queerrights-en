    "content": "I will use the word “delusion” to refer to a strong belief in something that is contrary to empirical evidence. This claim usually comes from several beliefs/assumptions: . | That trans people claim they are the other sex when they clearly aren’t, and that’s delusional because it’s denying reality. | That gender identity doesn’t exist at all, so claiming that it is at odds with one’s sex is delusional because it is claiming the existence of something (gender identity) that isn’t there. Sex characteristics alone determine what you are. | That gender identity exists, but it can never be misaligned with one’s sex characteristics and hence one’s assigned sex, so claiming that there is a misalignment is delusional because such a misalignment is impossible. | . All of these are untrue. “Trans people claim they are a different sex.” . Trans people are not claiming they are 100% the other sex physically, they are claiming they have a gender identity that tells them that they ought to have different sex characteristics or perception of them by others than they currently do (or used to have if they medically transitioned as far as they wish). This is what is called gender identity. In fact, trans people live every single day of their lives with this reality. Trans people wouldn’t even call themselves trans if they thought they already were and always have been physically the sex they wish they were, they would call themselves cis people of their gender identity. The very definition of “transgender” acknowledges the existence of sex characteristics and assigned sex. Going up to a trans person and saying “but you’re biologically still X” is rude not only because it’s usually none of your concern and because it often causes unnecessary gender dysphoria, but also because it is condescending: You’re assuming the person doesn’t already know this and needs you to tell them that. “Gender identity doesn’t exist.” . We have a lot of evidence that gender identity is an actually existing, most likely close to universal, and mostly unchangeable trait that people have. Gender identity proven by cis and mutilated intersex people . | The existence of gender identity is proven not only by the identification of trans people (who I assume a person claiming gender identity is made up doesn’t believe to begin with), but also cis people themselves. If gender identity didn’t exist, none of them would ever feel anything comparable to gender dysphoria, and yet they do: . | David Reimer was a dyadic cis man who underwent genital mutilation at 22 months to re-assign him and raise as female, after his nonconsensual circumcision (also genital mutilation) went wrong. Despite being raised as female from before gender identity was presumed to form (at 3/4 years), he ended up unhappy as a girl and transitioned to male. | Male newborns who are born with not fully formed or functional male genitalia experience a similar fate as David Reimer, because it is easier to create female genitals than it is to re-build male genitals. They tend to transition to male much more often than those who were dyadic and AFAB: . | In a study of 16 subjects, 2 were assigned and raised as male, while the other 14 were re-assigned and raised as female due to a condition affecting the pelvis in males. But 8 out of those 14 ended up identifying themselves as male during the course of the study, one had an unclear identity (they found out they were born male, got upset and refused to talk to the researchers after that), and only 5 seemed to be happy living as female (with no knowledge that they were born male). (Reiner and Gearhart, 2004 - archive link) | A review of 3 conditions affecting male genitalia also “clearly indicate[s] an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood”, although it also notes that the findings “are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens.” (meaning that there might also be a genetic, epigenetic, and/or social factor in determining gender identity). (Meyer-Bahlburg 2005 - archive link) | . | Women with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), which either causes higher testosterone levels, a lack of periods, and/or enlarged ovaries, should feel no distress over sometimes having masculine features, such as increased body and facial hair. After all, your gender is what your sex characteristics tell you, right? And yet, according to a qualitative study of 23 reproductive aged women by Amiri et. al. in 2014 (archive link), they do, indicating that they have some internal sense that this isn’t how their body is supposed to be. | Cis men who loose their genitalia or some of it’s functions in war, due to accidents, violent partners, or having an intersex trait should all feel 0 remorse over loosing their/lacking genitals if there was no gender identity. After all, they always are just what their sex charactertics tell them and there’s no gender identity that could make them feel a conflict between their body and mind. “Confused about your gender? - Look between your legs!”, as transphobes like to say. And yet they do feel distress - in fact, phalloplasty, which is a common genital surgery for medically transitioning transmasculine people, was first developed for cis men. | . | We can observe gender identity not only in the behavior and described feelings of both cis and trans people, but also in the brain. | . The neurological basis of gender identity . Notes: . | To all the gender abolitionists, non-binary people, and fellow feminists reading this: Hear me out completely, I’m not going to make the argument that you probably think I will. | Big thanks to Zoe Brain for this list of studies, where the majority of the following studies are taken from. | I updated some of the quotes to replace obsolete and stigmatizing terms like “gender identity disorder (GID)” with gender incongruence and marked these changes with []. | . Plenty of studies show that there are, on average, some differences in the structure and function of certain areas of the brain between cis dyadic women and men. The most obvious one is overall brain size, but this is simply due to men being on average bigger than women in general and doesn’t have any effect on intelligence. If adjusted to body size, brain size is the same on average for both men and women. The following argument won’t concern itself with brain size, but with other sexually dimorphic brain areas and functions. At least binary trans people’s brains tend to be somewhere between those 2 or closer to the brains of their desired sex in structure and function, than like their assigned sex - even before HRT. Here is a (probably incpmplete) list of the peer-reviewed studies showing that trans people’s gender identity is detectable even in their brain before any medical treatment: . | Berglund et. al. 2008 (archive link): “Male-to-female transsexuals show sex-atypical hypothalamus activation when smelling odorous steroids.” . | In simple terms: Trans women have a more female than male functional brain response to certain smells. | Flaws: Trans women only | Advantages: | . | Kruiver et. al. 2000 (archive link): “Male–to–female transsexuals have female neuron numbers in a limbic nucleus.” “The present findings of somatostatin neuronal sex differences in the BSTc and its sex reversal in the transsexual brain clearly support the paradigm that in transsexuals sexual differentiation of the brain and genitals may go into opposite directions and point to a neurobiological basis of [gender incongruence].” . | In simple terms: Trans women have female brain traits. | Flaws: Trans women only | Advantages: | . | Swaab 2004 (archive link): “Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation.” Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking. In the human brain, structural diferences have been described that seem to be related to gender identity and sexual orientation. | In simple terms: Gender identity (as well as sexual orientation) is structurally rooted in the brain and most likely not caused socially. | Flaws: | Advantages: | . | Zhou et. al. 1995 (archive link): “A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality.” “Our study is the first to show a female brain structure in genetically male transsexuals and supports the hypothesis that gender identity develops as a result of an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones.” . | In simple terms: Trans women have structural female brain traits. | Flaws: Trans women only | Advantages: | . | Garcia Falgueras et. al. 2008 (archive link): “A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity.” “We propose that the sex reversal of the INAH3 in transsexual people is at least partly a marker of an early atypical sexual differentiation of the brain and that the changes in INAH3 and the BSTc may belong to a complex network that may structurally and functionally be related to gender identity.” . | In simple terms: Gender identity could be rooted structurally in the brain. | Flaws: | Advantages: | . | Rametti et. al. 2010 (archive link): “White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment. A diffusion tensor imaging study.” “Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated FtM transsexuals is closer to the pattern of subjects who share their gender identity (males) than those who share their biological sex (females). Our results provide evidence for an inherent difference in the brain structure of FtM transsexuals.” . | In simple terms: Trans men have structural male brain traits. | Flaws: Trans men only | Advantages: Pre-HRT subjects, meaning that we can exclude the changes were artificially induced by hormones | . | Tanaka et. al. 2010 (archive link): “Regional cerebral blood flow changes in female to male gender identity disorder.” RESULTS: [Gender incongruent] subjects had a significant decrease in rCBF in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a significant increase in the right insula compared to control subjects. | . CONCLUSIONS: The ACC and insula are regions that have been noted as being related to human sexual behavior and consciousness. From these findings, useful insights into the biological basis of [gender incongruence] were suggested. | In simple terms: Trans men have functional male brain traits. | Flaws: Trans men only | Advantages: | . | Rametti et. al. 2010 (archive link): “The microstructure of white matter in male to female transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment. A DTI study” “Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated MtF transsexuals falls halfway between the pattern of male and female controls. The nature of these differences suggests that some fasciculi do not complete the masculinization process in MtF transsexuals during brain development.” . | . During HRT the brain further adjusts itself and becomes even more like the brains of cis people of the person’s gender identity: . | Pol et. al. 2006 (archive link): “ Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure” “Compared with controls, anti-androgen + estrogen treatment decreased brain volumes of male-to-female subjects towards female proportions, while androgen treatment in female-to-male subjects increased total brain and hypothalamus volumes towards male proportions.” . | Flaws: Small sample size (8 trans women, 6 trans men) | . | . Why the neurological findings do not justify perpetuating gender roles . Having said all the above things, it’s important to address a dangerous and very wrong conclusion that some people make upon hearing that men and women - even the trans ones! (gasp) - differ in their brains. Misogynists will think that this confirms their prejudices: That this therefore means women really do belong in the kitchen and are naturally bad at math (and maybe good at languages), and that feminism and any effort to abolish gender roles goes against science and human nature. Even those that support equality for all genders will claim things like “Men and women are equal, but different” - more specifically: Complementary (in regards to their intellectual abilities). This is, at least based on our current knowledge, not the case, and such conclusions are misinterpretations of the data. Note The following first 2 points and their examples are mostly directly taken from this 2019 article by Lise Elliot (archive link) and this 2020 article by Cordelia Fine and Carla Sanchis Segura (archive link). 1. The differences are tiny and there is gigantic overlap . The differences found between cis dyadic men and women are very small or literally non-existent, but are repeatedly blown out of proportion or made up by media and/or flawed methodology. Examples: . | Ingalhalikar et. al. 2014 (archive link) analyzed the brains of different age groups and of different sexes, and interpreted the results as showing that male and female brains are complementary, with female connections being mostly between hemispheres and male ones mostly within the hemispheres. This research also spread all across media, but this narrative is omitting the vast majority of connections that were shown to be fully identical between the sexes. Not the brains overall, but only small parts could be considered complementary. The origin of such differences is also unclear, see the 4th point further down. | Schaywitz et. al. (1995) (archive link) was a small study that claimed that language-processing is spread more evenly across the hemispheres in women than in men, which spread all over various media outlets, but a 2008 meta-analysis by Sommer et. al. (archive link) disproved this. | A review from 2017 of amygdala volume studies showed that men have a 10% larger amygdala, but after this was adjusted to overall brain size it was revealed that there is no proportional size difference between the sexes. https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2016.12.021 !!! (And by the way, activation patterns were also not found to be different.) https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neubiorev.2007.12.002 !!! . | In some studies, machine-learning algorithms were trained on datasets of brains to make the algorithms classify the brains by gender and often showed very high accuracy results (80% or higher). But the studies often used flawed methods of adjusting the brain size (as mentioned earlier, cis dyadic women’s brains are smaller on average because their bodies are smaller on average), and the algorithm mostly detected the sex of the brain’s owner based on size. Once the size was correctly adjusted, as it was done in a study in which Carla Sanchis Segura participated (archive link), the machine-learning algorithms were correct in only about 60% of cases, which is only 10% above pure chance/random guessing (50%) and much lower than the 80-90% accuracy from before. | Further, at least some evidence (archive link) shows that the algorithms have different definitions of what counts as a “male” or “female” brain, depending on the given set of brains and what subgroups they come from. So when applying the same algorithm on a different dataset than the one the algorithm was built on, the accuracy suddenly dramatically drops, sometimes even to lower than 50%. !!! This also supports the 4th point about the social influence of brain differences (see below). | . | . 2. Most brains are mosaics of “male” and “female” brain traits . A study analyzing 1400 brains in the areas that have previously been shown to have the biggest differences between the sexes (e.g. volume of brain regions, strength of connections between certain regions) showed that there is little internal consistency of each brain and that most brains are mosaics of “female” and “male” traits. Therefore it is extremely rare to have a “fully female” or “fully male” brain, almost all brains are mixed. Furthermore, the majority of mosaic combinations overlapped between men and women, so it’s also not like there is a set of “female” mosaics and “male” mosaics, most are shared by both. (Joel et. al., 2015 - archive link) . The authors conclude from this, that there is no “female” and “male” brain, although this should not be taken to mean it is impossible to look at a person’s brain and determine their gender, but rather that the brain cannot be classified according to sex like for example genitals are. Genitals are almost always . | internally consistent (you will rarely find genitals with both male and female traits naturally, only among some intersex people) and | have very little overlap (although male and female genitals at some point start out the same in the womb and have some comparable tissues (e.g. clitoris and penis), they later barely share any common shapes or functions). | . The fact that this is how the phrase “There is no male and female brain” is meant becomes more clear if you read the replies of other researchers to the authors and the authors’ responses: !!! . 3. Any found differences are at least partly caused socially . Some of the neural differences found in cis dyadic men and women actually stem from the social environment, such as epigenetic markers, as the article Cortes et. al. (2019) (archive link) concluded. This is due to neuroplasticity, which describes the brain’s capability to adapt and change to internal as well as external environments (mostly in childhood, but to a lesser degree also in adulthood). The fact that social influences also change the brain is further supported by the evidence brought up in the 1st point (see above) that showed how machine-learning algorithms for predicting the brain owner’s gender trained on brains from one subgroup suddenly had terrible accuracy when applied to brains from other subgroups. This might be because this other subgroup has some different cultural norms regarding gender and hence the brain adapts differently. Here is the Britannica article and a review article of 40 years of research on neuroplasticity if you want to read more about this in general. It should be remembered that neuroplasticity is not something an indvidual controls or chooses, and it is also by far not unlimited. Out of this wrong belief that neuroplasticity can change anything, some people have argued that trans people only have different brain structures and functions because they have actively convinced themselves that they are a different gender or lived as such, that this alone was able to change their neurons, and that therefore neuroplasticity disproves the hypothesis of inborn gender identity. But this hypothesis . | still lacks evidence, as there has been no succesful attempt to convert a trans person to being cis, which indicates that perhaps gender identity is one of the things that neuroplasticity cannot change | Has evidence against it, as even trans people who suppress their feelings show different brain structures than cis people of their assigned gender, such as Swaab and Garcia-Fulgaras (2009) !!! (archive link) found (emphasis mine): “One person we studied had untreated male gender dysphoria (S7), took no hormones and kept his transsexual feelings under wraps. He appeared to have a large INAH3 volume - in the male range - but a female INAH3 number of neurons (68) and a female BSTc somatostatin neuron number (95). Hence, this individual’s hypothalamic characteristics were mid-way between male and female values.” . | . 4. If gender roles are natural, it just proves there is no need to further enforce them culturally . Even if we were to prove that women and men tend to be better or worse at certain intellectual tasks due to neural differences, we still have to show that these “natural gender roles” happen to fall in line with our already existing “cultural gender roles”. And even if these natural differences turn out to fall in line with our already existing expectations, we should still fight against artificially enhancing and encouraging these tendencies, as those who naturally don’t, can’t, and/or don’t want to fit them - which we know do exist - are being hurt by that, while enforcing or not enforcing the natural tendencies doesn’t make a difference for those that naturally fit them anyway. Therefore, abolishing artificial (cultural) enforcement of proven natural gender traits in the form of gender roles has a net positive, as it allows those who naturally don’t fit them to live happily without making it any worse for those that do fit them naturally. The studies so far done all have some flaws: They are often only done on trans women, only sometimes on trans men, and (so far) never on non-binary people. They often also have a small sample size and are rarely tested again in more studies, more and larger replications are necessary to further confirm any hypothesis. We also don’t know if some of those differences might actually be connected to other traits, like sexuality. As a 2015 review of studies on this matter (although I don’t know which ones were included, maybe the above list has some that were not and it was also done 5 years ago in which much could have changed) finds: . “For a number of sexually dimorphic brain structures or processes, signs of feminisation or masculinisation are observable in transsexual individuals, which, during hormonal treatment, partly seem to further adjust to characteristics of the desired sex. Still, it appears the data are quite inhomogeneous, mostly not replicated and in many cases available for male-to-female transsexuals only. As the prevalence of homosexuality is markedly higher among transsexuals than among the general population, disentangling correlates of sexual orientation and gender identity is a major problem.” (Smith et. al. 2015 - archive link) . Summary and conclusion of current findings . | There are neural differences between the brains of cis dyadic men and women. | Some of the differences are demonstrably due to culture and hormones. | Most of these “male” and “female” brain traits are present in both men and women and it is rare to find internally consistent brains, making brain differences more similar to height differences than genital differences between the sexes. | . | There are neural differences between the brains of cis and trans people of the same assigned gender. | The research however is still lacking due to small sample sizes and lacking replications. We also don’t know yet how other factors, such as sexuality, might factor into this. But apart from this, current findings do consistently show: | Trans people’s brains are usually in between those of cis people of both sexes in key areas and become more like those of cis people of their gender identity as they take hormones and live as their gender identity. This supports the idea that some of the differences are due to culture and hormones, but also indicates that some are inborn, which might be exactly those parts that determine a person’s physical gender identity (ability to recognize certain sex characteristics as their own or foreign). | Social identification, e.g. “I recognize myself in he/him pronouns/a male name/male clothing (because my society has taught me they indicate the addressed person has a male body and I ought to have a male body too)” is, of course, learned - for trans people as much as it is for cis people. Nobody is born already thinking “Dresses are female” or “Michael is a male name”. | This doesn’t mean it should be disrespected, because most (both cis and trans) people still feel deeply about purely social phenomena - in fact, as we’ve seen, social environments can literally change our brains and it’s unclear if or how we can undo that - and there is literally no need, absolutely no rational reason for you to purposefully bring them distress by disrespecting this social identification and calling them the wrong pronouns or name. Even though it’s “just” a social construct, it sure is strong and you surely won’t abolish it by making individual people feel bad. | . | . | . “Gender identity can’t be misaligned with sex.” . If trans people weren’t truly one gender trapped in the body of another and their distress was due to something other than that, then it follows that medical and social transition - which aligns their gender identity with outer factors - couldn’t be as effective as it is at minimizing gender incongruence and the accompanying dysphoria. In fact, there should not only be no improvement if one’s gender identity always aligned with one’s sex characteristics - there should be a worsening, because now it is being wrongly misaligned while the actual cause of the distress still wasn’t addressed. Yet this isn’t what we see happening in reality, so this theory must be false based on empirical data. Recognition by institutions . Gender identity is also recognizes as a real, existing trait that can be different from sex by the following reputable institutions (not an exhaustive list): . | American Psychological Association | American Medical Association | American Psychoanalytic Association | Human Rights Campaign | American Academy of Pediatrics | American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians | Royal College of Psychiatrists | United Nations | United Kingdom’s National Health Service | . While this does not automatically mean it must be right - simply appealing to authority is not enough -, I have already explained the scientific basis of these assertions. There also seems to be no reason why they would lie about gender identity being real or not real, as it doesn’t serve their interests. It would be in trans people’s interests for sure, but it’s unlikely that less than 1% of the population has somehow infiltrated all of these institutions and made all involved psychologists and doctors adhere to “the gender ideology”, or whatever else reactionaries may label the factual assertion that gender exists.

    "content": "“Claiming to be a different gender than assigned is like claiming to be a different age, species, or ethnicity.” (slippery slope argument) . Gender is very unlike age, species, or race (if you use it as a synonym for ethnicity) due to 2 factors: . | Sex characteristics, which gender is based on, can be changed, while neither biological age, nor species, nor ethnicity can be changed. | People who say they wish they were or are a different age/species/ethnicity usually don’t say so because they literally cannot recognize themselves in the mirror due to their “age/species/race characteristics”, while trans people do fail to do so due to their sex characteristics. There is no diagnosis or consistently reported occurrence of “age/species/race incongruence”. | . In more detail: . Biological age changes in an exclusively linear fashion, always upwards. When people say they identify as a certain age, they are a. pedophiles trying to justify their paraphilia by saying it’s fine if they date (read: abuse) children, because they “identify as children” too. These “transage” people are dangerous for children and can never live a fulfilling and happy life because any child they end up “dating” will eventually grow up, destroying the relationship. Transgender people on the other hand are not dangerous and are able to live happy and be trans at the same time. b. people who mean it culturally/socially/psychologically, more like a metaphor rather than literally or to justify any criminal acts. The latter group is not expecting any rights - like being allowed to date children of their “identified age” - for that. It’s like when teens say they “were born in the wrong generation”, adults still feeling like they’re children in regards to their abilities or readiness for an independent life, or elderly people saying they still feel like they’re young on the inside. While they may sometimes wish they biologically changed to that age, it’s usually because of the benefits of that time (e.g. less illness, less responsibilities, etc.) and not because they literally cannot recognize themselves with their “age characteristics” anymore. They can, but perhaps don’t like what they’re seeing or what expectations are made about them based on this. Species also cannot be biologically changed. If you see someone saying they identify as a different species than humans they most likely mean it in a spiritual or metaphorical sense, not physical. If they mean physically, they might be mentally unwell or trying to justify their zoophilia (also a paraphilia). Race - as in ethnicity - also cannot be biologically changed, there are only very rare occurrences of skin colour changing by itself and the affected people are usually distressed by it. Skin colour is also only one factor of ethnicity. If a person says they identify as a different ethnicity than they biologically are, they most likely mean it culturally. For example if they are a white U.S.-American but were raised in a black U.S.-American family (or the other way around), they might feel culturally black, even though they are fully aware they are ethnically not and usually do not want to biologically change that. There is no diagnosis of “race incongruence”, those people can still recognize their biological characteristics connected to their ethnicity as their own. Even if there might sometimes be some wishing to fit in better with the rest of their family, it is due to outside factors like society only seeing same-ethnicity families as ideal families, not because they cannot recognize their “race characteristics” in the mirror by themselves. “Wanting to modify perfectly healthy sex characteristics is like wanting to cut off healthy limbs (and should be forbidden)” (comparison to body integrity identity disorder) . Body integrity identity disorder (BIID) is a neurological disorder in which a person wants to make themselves and live as disabled in some way despite being physically healthy - e.g. amputate or paralyze healthy parts of their body, blind themselves, or make themselves go deaf. People with BIID usually feel like they weren’t meant to have a certain limb or certain abilities from a young age and the line at which they wish to amputate their limbs remains stable over the course of their lifetime. A small study !!! shows that their brains are mapped in a way that causes them to be unable to fully feel and use certain body parts. !!! Some small studies have showed a positive effect if they were given the chance to actually let the unwanted limb be amputated. !!! This of course, at first sight, seems to be similar to what trans people go through, just less specific. However, there are some important differences: . | BIID is a wish to be disabled, which is in contradiction to live a healthy life (hence it is a disorder), while gender incongruence is a wish to live and function normally as another gender (hence a harmless variation of human existence). People with BIID seek to remove body parts or abilities, and while trans people sometimes also do when those are exclusive to the gender they do not wish to live as (e.g. trans men wanting their breasts gone or trans women getting genital surgery), they at the same time wish to gain new abilities that are exclusive to the gender they wish to live as (e.g. trans women gain new, reconstructed genitals, rather than merely loosing their previous one’s). Even if it’s not always entirely possible, this is due to current medicine lacking, and not because trans people want to lack those certain functions. | BIID is much less studied than gender incongruence. There are endless studies showing that social and medical transition improve a trans person’s life, while only very few and small studies have been done on amputated people with BIID, although those do show that their quality of life improves upon amputation. (Blom et. al. 2012 - archive link and Bou Khalil &amp; Richa 2012 - archive link) | BIID feelings lessen with the use of anti-depressants and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)(see already cited Bou Khalil &amp; Richa (2012) study), while trans people’s gender incongruence is not reduced by these less invasive treatments. !!! | . As for whether one or the other is forbidden: The question is whether such an amputation - whether of limbs, resulting in disability, or breasts, resulting in a different sex characteristic - harms or doesn’t. If a person has such severe BIID and all other treatments are exhausted, and they are about to amputate their unwanted limb themselves and maybe put themselves in even more danger than if they were amputated professionally in a hospital, then perhaps an amputation would do more good than harm, and is therefore morally defensible until there is a way to treat BIID without actually making the person disabled. As for trans people, it has already been proven time and time again that SRS really does improve people’s lives, even if it is technically “removing a healthy body part” (and reconfiguring it, depending on what surgery we’re talking about), and is therefore also morally good.

One can be trans and have dimorphism and/or eating disorders, but they are not necessarily always connected. Some trans people develop dimorphism in the sense that they overestimate their unwanted sex characteristics and think they are more noticable than they really are, some trans people also develop eating disorders due to stress or while repressing their trans identities. Some people with dimorphism and/or eating disorders might also misinterpret their issues of being trans, and some trans people might misinterpret their gender dysphoria as dimorphism.

Look for these qualities in any study you cite, regardless of topic or your position.

Researchers themselves sometimes make wrong conclusions about their data too, so you can’t necessarily rely on what they claim their data shows either.

    "title": "Methodology",
    "content": "Have a representative sample . | Depending on your sample of people, you will get different results. | For example: You want to test whether the average person likes the colour blue or red more. But you take the entire or the majority of your sample from a blue-colour-fanclub, so your results end up being skewed toward blue. It won’t be representative of the general population, but more representative of the blue-colour-fanclub. | This is also true regardless of how big your sample is: If it’s all from biased groups, your results will be biased too, no matter how big your biased sample is. | Actual examples of studies making such an error: Older studies on whether homosexuality is a pathology frequently used samples from prisons or clinics. But they weren’t representative of all gay people, as no gay people who lived stable and happy lives were included. This made it look as if all gay people are ill, so psychologists assumed homosexuality must be inherently unhealthy, since they never saw a healthy gay person. | . | . Have a useful control group . | If you want to test whether one specific thing has a certain influence on people, you need a control group which is as identical to your test group as possible in all ways, except for the specific thing that you want to test the influence of. This way you exclude the influence of factors that you don’t want to test for, which could otherwise skew your results. | For example: You want to test whether taking a pill for a few week makes people smarter. | You take a sample of people to be the control group that doesn’t receive the pill (and also just so happens to consist entirely of kindergarten children) and one sample of people to be the test group that does receive the pill (and also just so happens to consist entirely of university students). [insert reactionary joke about how university students are stupider than kindergarten children nowadays because some of them accept trans people] | After a few weeks of one group taking the pill and one not taking the pill, you test their intelligence. The result will probably be that the testing group of university students is smarter than the control group of kindergarteners. | But you cannot make any conclusions about the effects of the pill based on that, as you haven’t excluded the factor of age. This means the difference could be due to the pill, but it could also be due to the age difference, and looking only at your study (and ignoring general knowledge about how older people are usually smarter than literal infants), you have no way of telling which one it is. You didn’t test if the pill worked, you tested the difference in intelligence of 2 vastly different groups that have a lot of differences between them, which could all be responsible for the difference. | . | . | This can also sometimes make up for the lack of a representative sample, since now you’re looking at the difference between groups that are both similarly representative or not representative of the general population. Now it’s about relative and not absolute results of whatever you’re testing. | Another example: You want to test whether psychotherapy improves people’s psychological wellbeing. You take a sample that is convenient for you as a researcher: One control group of clinically depressed individuals who won’t get therapy, and one testing group of equally clinically depressed individuals who will get therapy. It doesn’t matter that both of these groups are not representative of the general population (who isn’t mostly clinically depressed) since you’re looking at the difference between those groups to study the effects of psychotherapy. | Actual studies making such an error: Studies about conversion therapy for sexuality that supposedly show that it works, as they literally never have control groups. A control group is needed to make sure this isn’t just natural fluctuation of orientation or identifying as straight over time simply due to pressure. Such studies, by the way, also always lack the next point. | . | . Have reliable measuring methods . Have methods that actually measure what you’re trying to measure and measure it as accurately as possible. More specifically this means: . | Ask questions as specific as possible and define terms as specific as possible. | For example: Don’t ask “Are you old?”, ask “Are you above the biological age of ___?” | . | If it is a controversial or sensitive subject that most of your sample probably already has strong, pre-existing opinions about (and you’re trying to record something other than just people’s opinions), make sure already established beliefs and prejudices don’t get in the way of answering the questions honestly. If this is impossible to rule out, use a different method to measure the results. | For example: . | You want to test how much a certain workout routine has helped people loose weight. However, people could lie about the results if you just go ask them in person, because our society is not neutral on the topics of thinness, fitness, and whose fault it is if a person fails to achieve a certain, vague ideal of it. | Instead, don’t ask them in person, but give them an anonymous form to fill out. Such an environment, where no person is directly present and the information they give cannot possibly bring shame upon them since it’s anonymous, will make them least inclined to lie. | Or, even better, don’t rely on their answers at all. Weigh them before and after yourself. | . | Actual studies making such an error: Studies supposedly showing that conversion therapy for orientation works usually just ask their subjects whether their orientation has changed, even though there are more reliable ways to test whether a person feels attraction to someone (e.g. brain scans, measuring genital responses, pupil dilation in response to certain images). They also tend to not have any clear definition of “orientation” established beforehand. | Also, a note: Surveys are not inherently flawed, just keep in mind they show the opinions of people and might not always correspond to reality, especially when it comes to controversial or stigmatized topics. | . | If possible, don’t rely on memory. Each time a person remembers something, they remember it slightly differently than they did before, without realizing. !!! This remembering can also be influenced by newer memories and what the person may currently want to believe about their past. Instead follow up long-term so you can be sure the person’s past has been corrected more accurately (see last point). | . Regardless of what methods you choose, they all have a certain bias and this should always be remembered when making conclusions about the data. Follow-up long term . | Related to the big sample and replication part: Follow-up long-term. Some results and effects on people are only temporary and this could skew your results if you only ask them right after the experiment or procedure that you’re testing. | As previously mentioned (point about reliable measuring methods), our memory is also far from accurate and in fact changes every time we recall something. | For example: You want to see if helium can help trans women make their voices more feminine, so you get a sample of them and give them helium. Their voices get higher, you record your results right after giving the helium and conclude that helium is a good alternative to voice training. But in reality the effect of helium on the voice fades pretty fast, depending on how much they inhaled. You failed to record this pretty important aspect of this new procedure because you made no long-term follow-ups. | Actual examples of studies making such an error: Studies claiming that conversion therapy (whether for sexuality or gender identity) works. They usually only ask participants right after the therapy and then conclude they have really changed, but both sexuality and gender identity (or their fluctuations within a certain range with certain frequency) are enduring and stable things for the majority of people. | . | .

    "title": "Conclusions",
    "content": "Use a big sample and/or replicate results . | Doing one small study, even if you follow all other rules, can be anecdotal evidence purely by accident. This is why it’s good to, at least when possible (which, to be fair, is pretty hard when it comes to GRS minorities), have big samples or multiple studies that are able to replicate the results. With more and more data that comes to similar conclusions you can be more and more certain that the results were not just an accident or coincidence. If you don’t have a big sample or many replications of the result, note that in your conclusions. | For example: You want to test whether oranges always fall in line if you drop them on a wooden table. So you drop 3 oranges once on a wooden table, and they all fall in line, so you conclude oranges always fall in one line when you drop them on the table. However, you have dropped them just once and only 3 oranges, and your result might have been purely accidental. Instead you need to repeat your experiment many times or use more oranges to make sure it wasn’t just pure luck that one time when they all fell in line. | . | . Take into account the drop-out rate . | Sometimes it’s impossible to follow up some subjects (e.g. they refuse to further participate, don’t fill out the form, etc.). In other words, they drop out of the study. In that case, leave those people out entirely from your conclusions and only note that they dropped out. Don’t fall back to a “default result” you expect them to have if they didn’t respond, you have no way of knowing what actually happened to them. | For example: You want to see whether brushing your teeth with a certain toothpaste will make their teeth whiter in a few weeks of using it. | You recruit 30 subjects, but 13 of them don’t return any results as you had agreed with them and hence drop out. For 4 of the remaining subjects, their teeth got whiter; for 5 of them they stayed the same; for 8 of them the teeth got more yellow-ish. | If you assume that the teeth of the 13 dropped subjects also got whiter, you get an overall result of the toothpaste working, as it worked for 17 subjects, didn’t do anything for 5, and made things worse for only 8. | But this significantly skews the actual results: Assuming the 13 drop-out subjects’ teeth improved is completely baseless. Even worse, without you assuming that these 13 drop-out subjects improved, the result would be the opposite, since otherwise there would be a majority of people for whom the toothpaste did nothing (5) or made them worse (8). Instead you should just not count these subjects as any result group and exclude them from your conclusions. | . | Actual examples of studies making such an error: Studies claiming that conversion therapy for sexuality works sometimes have a big drop-out rate, but then the researches just assume they did change, to prove that the therapy worked. But in reality it might just as well be that they didn’t change and maybe even resent ever having agreed to that study and therapy, because it maybe made things worse. | . | . Don’t jump to conclusions . | Correlation does not equal causation. Even if you do find a link between 2 things after following all of the above points (representative samples, replicated results, good methodology, exclusion of third factors), don’t assume that one of the things causes the other or in which direction the causation works. | For example: You observe a correlation between drinking water and being thirsty. But you can’t conclude from that that drinking water makes people thirsty. In fact, upon further investigation you realize people being thirsty is what causes them to drink water. | . | Also: Something coming before something second does not mean the former caused the latter. | For example: A person dyed their hair blue and later bought a ukulele. You can’t conclude from that that dying your hair blue causes ukulele-buying, even if the hair came first. They might not be connected at all, or connected to a third factor such as being part of a friend group that always liked both of these things. Dying their hair was just cheaper than a ukulele so the person could afford the dye sooner and had to wait until their next paycheck to buy the ukulele. | . | . ",

The same group of people is also described as LGBT+ or other derivatives of it, but I decided against it as it commonly leads to either exclusionism or the acronym getting endlessly long. “Queer” may have a history of being used as a slur against LGBT+ people, but it’s the most frequently preferred and the third most accepted according to this survey (archive link). Those who don’t prefer this term tend to be - among other factors - exclusionists (archive link). This is not to say that anyone who uses the term LGBT+ is an exclusionist, as plenty of non-exclusionist people use it (including me), alongside other terms.

    "content": ". | Basics - gender identity, assigned sex | Figuring out - gender dysphoria &amp; euphoria | Transition - social, legal, medical | Purpose of the site | . Just so we’re all on the same page: Some basics about what trans people even are. Note: Terminology for trans topics varies wildly. There are plenty of websites, organizations, people, and scientific studies who use words slightly if not completely differently than this site does. Don’t automatically assume they mean the exact same thing as explained here, make sure you check how they define terms before you make your interpretations. Basics - gender identity, assigned sex . Transgender people (or short “trans people”) are people whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. The opposite is cisgender or cis. | If you’re thinking “Why do we need a word for cis people? Can’t we just call them normal?” - it’s the same reason why you don’t say “black and normal people”. It implies the other one is not normal - not in the statistical, but in the moral way, as in evil or sick. | . All people - whether cis or trans - should (as far as it is possible and safe) be gendered according to their gender identities, because it reduces unnecessary and unproductive distress for the addressed person. In those cases where the person is also living/trying to live in accordance with their gender identity, it is also less confusing for everyone. | Trans men are people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) but have a male gender identity. | Transmasculine is a broader term that includes anyone who was AFAB and has a non-female gender identity, including non-binary people. | “FtM” is a term that stands for “female-to-male” and is often used as a synonym for trans men, more rarely for all transmasculine people. However, some transmasculine people have an issue with it because it mentions the assigned gender of the person, so please avoid using it unless the specific person you’re talking about told you they’re okay with or even prefer it. I only mention the term because it is often used in scientific studies. | . | Trans women, transfeminine people, and “MtF”s (male-to-female) are the corresponding terms for those who were assigned male at birth (AMAB). | Non-binary people are people of any assigned sex who have a gender identity that is not always or exclusively male or female - for example it could be inbetween (neutrois), fluctuating (genderfluid), absent (agender, generless), a combination of them (multigender), etc. Many non-binary people use singular they/them pronouns in English, so it is usually a more or less safe bet to refer to them as such. Some also use neopronouns (e.g. ze/zir). | . Gender identity is an internal sense of what one’s sex characteristics are ought (supposed) to be like and/or be referred to as. | Gender identity is not chosen for anyone, neither cis nor trans people. | Gender identity is not what gendered expectations or roles one fits better, and being trans is not just disliking one’s assigned gender role. | Gender identity is not voluntary gender expression (how a person dresses, cuts their hair, etc.). While gender expression is usually one that aligns with a given society’s expectations for one’s gender identity, it doesn’t have to be and is not what determines a person’s gender identity. | Having a voluntary gender expression that does not correspond with societal expectations for one’s gender identity is called gender non-conformity (gnc). Both cis and trans people can be gnc. Gnc is not the same as non-binary or trans at all, the former is about expression and the latter about identity. | Many organizations will (in my opinion very wrongly) define being trans as having an identity or expression that doesn’t match one’s assigned sex, which technically means gnc people are also included as trans, but this site will not be including gnc people as trans because this is the widely held opinion among queer people themselves. | Crossdressing (formerly also called “transvestism”) is an “extreme” form of gnc and are often confused with trans people. However, crossdressers differ fundamentally from trans people of the same assigned sex in that crossdressers change their appearance for entertainment (e.g. drag/caricaturing, acting), and in some cases sexual desires, while trans people do so to be more authentic to themselves. | . | . | Being trans is not connected to sexual orientation, it isn’t just being really really gay or similar. Trans people can have any sexual orientation, including gay/lesbian, bi, ace, or straight (from the perspective of their gender identity, e.g. a gay trans man is attracted to other men). Gender identity is about what gender(s) you are, orientation is what gender(s) you love. | Gender identity is not necessarily always what gender one is perceived by others - or in other words passes - as. Sometimes people cannot live out their gender identity due to various circumstances, like stigma around being trans, and even when they can they might not always pass as the gender they’re trying to live as. I will refer to the gender a given person is actually perceived as by others and living as as perceived/lived gender. | . In many trans circles people will often say “gender” to mean specifically “gender identity”. I won’t be doing that here to make absolutely sure there is no confusion about what aspect of “gender” (identity, expression, perceived, lived, expectations) is meant. Note: It’s true that trans people often look like cis gnc people or even experiment with crossdressing before they realize they’re trans and/or let you know. But please do not pressure a seemingly cis gnc person you know to tell you whether they are trans or not. If they are they would tell you when they feel ready, don’t put them on the spot or put pressure on them. If they aren’t trans, the question just becomes meaningless in the first place. The majority of people who are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender are not trans, and not all trans people are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender. If you see a gnc cis person and worry that they are actually trans, but just haven’t realized yet because they don’t know trans people exist: Casually bring up the topic of trans people without making any connections or references to them personally. This way you can be sure they know trans people exist without having to put them on the spot or creating pressure. | Assigned sex/gender at birth is what sex a person is assumed to be at birth, usually based on their genitals, and what gender identity they are expected to develop based on that. This doesn’t always correspond to a person’s actual natal sex, as it is the case with intersex people, whose genitals might a) be ambiguous or b) not be indicative of their entire sex anatomy. | Sex (as a biological trait) has 2 common definitions: . | (a) (strictly biological) What gametes an organism produces (big = female, small = male); | (b) (more common when referring to humans) The sum of an organisms sex characteristics (e.g. sex chromosomes, gamete sex, reproductive organs/internal genitalia, external genitalia, secondary sex characteristics (e.g. breasts, beard)) | . | . Figuring out - gender dysphoria &amp; euphoria . The way one figures out whether they are trans is by not being able to recognize one’s body’s gendered traits and/or gendered words, pronouns, names, etc. directed at oneself (incongruence). | Often this incongruence of sex characteristics and/or their perception by society causes distress (gender dysphoria), and relieving this conflict causes joy or relief (gender euphoria). | All of these feelings are ideally alleviated through transition and are therefore not inherent or the defining trait of being trans. They are, however, the currently only way of deducting one’s gender identity. | Since cis people can sometimes feel them too if put in situations that invalidate their gender identities, we can conclude that everyone has a gender identity. The reason why many cis people say they don’t “feel” like a gender and are confused about what the hell trans people are talking about is because gender, for most people, is like a bone - you only feel it when it’s broken. | . A person can figure out they are trans at any age and under all kinds of circumstances. For example, they might have previously repressed themselves from months to entire decades and tried to compensate by being a stereotype of their assigned gender, which might make a coming out as trans unexpected. This doesn’t make their gender identity any less real. The psychological diagnosis of gender incongruence is usually needed for medical transition. It includes both gender dysphoria and euphoria. Formerly it was also called “transsexualism”, “gender identity disorder”, and “gender dysphoria”, which have all been given up due to being stigmatizing. Transition - social, legal, medical . Trans people usually aim for transition to align their lived/perceived gender (what gender one lives as; is perceived as by others/passes as) with their gender identity. Transition means aligning one’s . | social life (e.g. name, pronouns, usually involves coming out) | legal documents (gender marker, legal name) and/or | sex characteristics as far as it is medically possible | . …with one’s gender identity. These are called social, legal, and medical transition respectively. Everyone’s transition looks differently, because different trans people will have different needs, just like cis people differ in their bodies, understandings of gender, and expression too. | Medical transition can include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone-blockers for transfeminine people - testosterone for transmasculine people) and sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) (yes, plural - “the surgery” is a myth and there’s actually a lot of them). SRS is usually irreversible, HRT has some reversible and some irreversible effects. | Adolescents under the age of 16 are only ever given hormone blockers and only with parental consent and psychological recommendation. Hormone blockers are reversible and in the vast majority of cases cause no harm if taken according to instructions. They simply offset natal puberty as long as the blockers are taken and are regularly used for cis children whose puberty is starting too early as well. | . | Hormones change a majority of visible sex characteristics, ranging from fat distribution to skin texture, and surgeries remove the rest of the remaining visible sex characteristics of one’s assigned sex as needed, or can enhance those of one’s desired sex as needed. | . People who have taken any steps toward transition (whether social, legal, or medical) and later went back some or all steps to their assigned gender are called detransitioners. This term includes . | people who were entirely wrong about being trans and are technically cis. | people who realized they are non-binary rather than binary trans. | people who detransitioned due to social, reproductive, or financial issues and might retransition later. | . Purpose of the site . The purpose of this section of the site is to provide evidence for the validity of this narrative and debunking misconceptions and opposing narratives, such as those fearmongering about the dangers of “gender ideology”.

    "content": "A small group of LGB people oppose being grouped with trans people into once movement. A part of them thinks so because they think that being trans is homophobic because it’s either . | a) making gay/lesbian cis people straight as the other binary gender (debunked here) or | b) forcing cis gay/lesbian people to be straight. | . The latter comes from the false belief that trans people are forcing anyone to date them (debunked here) and that trans people are not really their gender identity or that this gender identity is irrelevant to attraction and only chromosomes and reproductive organs (which cannot be currently changed) matter (which is also untrue, as visible sex characteristics are more influential for most people’s attractions - a man dating a (female-presenting) trans woman is not gay, and therefore a man dating a (male-presenting) trans man is not straight). But another part of those people simply think that gay/lesbian/bi people face too different issues to be grouped with trans people, which is what will be addressed here. | Most trans people are gay/lesbian or bi, so even if you included only LGB people, a majority of trans people would still be included. It doesn’t make much sense to throw such a fit as people advocating for a split usually do over literally less than a fourth of trans people who are straight and would be excluded with such a split. | Arguments against gay/lesbian and trans people are literally the same, just rephrased a bit - yes, all of them. And therfore LGB and T people should stick together in fighting them, because their nature/basic thought process is the exact same. They all stem from the same reactionary attitude. Take a look at this table: | . | Argument/Occurance | Against homosexuality | Against transness | . | Appeal to nature | “Homosexuality is unnatural” | “Being trans is unnatural” | . | Illness | “Being gay is a mental illness.” | “Being trans is a mental illness.” | . | Traumatic origin | “Being gay is caused by childhood sexual trauma/issues with society’s expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc.” | “Being trans is caused by sexual trauma/issues with society’s expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc.” | . | The agenda | “The gay agenda is to make all our kids gay!” | “The trans agenda is to make all our kids trans!” - e.g. ROGD | . | The agenda but it’s even more evil | (Related to the traumatic origin argument) “Gay recruiters target especially vulnerable, traumatized/unstable/autistic/supposedly unable to think for themselves people to lure in.” | “The trans agenda especially preys on autistic cis girls/gay cis boys/etc. to convince them they’re male.” | . | Physical harm | “Homosexuality is harmful - look at all the AIDs, the gay bowel syndrome, anal sex causing incontinence, etc.” | “Being trans is harmful - those hormones cause cancers and heart disease, the surgeries leave phantom sensations, etc.” | . | Curability | “Lesbians are only lesbian because they never had a good dick.”, same in reverse but less frequent | “Trans people just need to be reminded of their biology by reproducing.” or “Trans people just have to be forced to live as their assigned gender long enough to really see how great it is, then they’ll become cis.” | . | Exes | The ex-gay movement - Often got over-proportional and misrepresenting attention, making it seems like a much more viable and universal “solution” (of something that doesn’t need to be “solved”) - or solution at all - than it is. | Detransitioners who specifically blame their or their doctors’ mistakes on trans people as a whole and get over-proportional attention (especially widespread in Great Britain right now), making it seem like detransition is much more common than it really is. | . | Choice theory | “Being gay is a lifestyle choice.” | “Being trans is a lifestyle choice.” | . | Failure | “Gay men/lesbian women are just failed men/women who couldn’t get a girl/guy.” | “Trans people are too ugly as their assigned gender so they turn to transition.” or “Trans people just can’t come with being gender non-conforming as their assigned gender.” or “Trans people are just gays/lesbians who couldn’t get a guy/girl.” | . | Attention-seeking and trendiness | “Gay/lesbian/bi people just want attention, they don’t have a real personality, so they’re hopping onto a trend to feel special.” | “Trans people just want attention, they have no real personality, so they’re hopping onto a trend to feel special.” | . | Don’t shove it in my face | “I’m fine with gay people, as long as they don’t shove it in my face.” (read: as long as they don’t publicly exist at all and never hold hands in public, never kiss in public, never appear in any media, never go on a date in public like straight people do, oh, you know, only literally all the time without a second glance from anyone) | “I’m fine with trans people as long as they don’t shove it in my face” - and then in the same breath they will make the next argument: | . | Tell everyone | “Gay/lesbian people are immoral if they don’t let everyone know they’re gay/lesbian to avoid letting down a straight person who fell in love with them or making an employer hire them even though they disagree with ‘their lifestyle’ and wouldn’t want to hire them if they knew.” | “Trans people are immoral if they don’t tell everyone they are trans, otherwise they are luring in and lying to people and it’s justified if they get murdered for it.” | . | Don’t hit on me | “Yeah I’m fine that you’re gay, just don’t hit on me.” | “Yeah I’m fine that you’re trans, but I won’t sleep with you.” | . | Slippery slope | “If we accept homosexuality, what will come next? Accepting zoophilia, pedophilia, going around naked outside? Society will degregate!” | “If we accept transgender people, what will come next? Accepting transspecies (=zoophilia), transethnicity, transage (=pedophilia)? I identify as a penguin!” | . | Appeal to religion | “God said homosexuality is a sin” | “Rejecting god’s creation is a sin” | . | God makes no mistakes | “God made so that male and female are complementary in their anatomy, he made us to be heterosexual physically and everyone has to follow that. He doesn’t make mistakes.” | “God can’t accidentally put a female/male/ambiguous soul in a male/female body, he doesn’t make mistakes.” | . The lack of creativity of bigots is impressive, isn’t it? Literally all the anti-trans talking points are recycled homophobia.

    "title": "TERFs",
    "content": "What is a “TERF” and is it a slur? . “TERF” is an acronym referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminism or a person adhering to that set of beliefs. As all radical feminists, TERFs see the main axis of oppression in society being the patriarchy (a system/society with subordination of all other genders to men), which arose due to (cis dyadic) women bearing more cost in reproduction than (cis dyadic) men. Hence they advocate for abolishing the patriarchy, which would also abolish all other axis’ of oppression. Radical feminism is not inherently trans-exclusionary. TERFs, unlike trans-inclusionary or trans-neutral radical feminists, usually conclude from this basic presumption that all gender-related oppression is due to having a certain set of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs, hence it is sex- rather than gender-based. Since both chromosomes and reproductive organs cannot be changed with current medicine, dyadic trans people forever remain the gender they were assigned, and from this it follows that trans women are not oppressed as women at all. Alternatively, other TERFs argue that socialization/gendered life experiences from early childhood on play the deciding factor. Since even the most aware trans people notice at maybe 3 or 4 years of age and only a minority of them have the courage and ssubsequent support to socially transition so young, all trans people automatically don’t have early enough socialization as their gender identity to be recognized as that. Because of these beliefs, TERFs will to call all transfeminine people “trans identified males” (TIM) and transmasculine people “trans identified females” (TIF). Intersex women and men are usually viewed as defective by TERFs and ignored otherwise, even though it challenges the basic presumptions of the former TEF group emphasizing reproduction. Some TERFs will say that the word “TERF” is a slur due to the fact that it has been often used on a derogatory way on the internet toward them. While it’s true that many people made a habit out of using it against anyone they think they don’t like, this doesn’t qualify it as a slur. It is not targeted at an ethnic/sexual/etc. (some trait that one doesn’t choose) group. TERFs are a minority, but a political one - not anything comparable to an ethnic or sexual minority. People choose their political beliefs. Saying TERF is a slur is like saying “Nazi” is a slur. This is not to imply that TERFs come anywhere near Nazis (comparing those would make Nazis look way less terrible than they really are), but to show that TERF is a neutral descriptor of a person’s political beliefs. The fact that people view it negatively doesn’t make it a slur. “Terms like “menstruator” are dehumanizing because I am more than my reproductive organs. I should be allowed to call myself a woman.” . *the entire trans community nods in agreement* . Terms like “menstruator” are made exactly to not be used as a synonym for “woman”. They are meant to simply be more percice when talking about biological functions, by saying “menstruator” or “people who menstruate” you are shwoing that . | it’s not just women who menstruate (e.g. some trans men and non-binary people do too even though a majority of them is deeply uncomfortable with that) and | not all women menstruate (e.g. girls, post-menopausal women, intersex women, women who had hysterectomy, some women who are permanently on birth control, trans women) and that womanhood is not defined by this biological function. In fact, in sum about half of all cis girls/women don’t menstruate (archive link). | . The same goes for terms like “people with prostate” etc. If someone tried to force you stop using the word “woman” in the name of trans rights, tell them they’re harming trans people with this since trans people want the exact opposite of equating gender and biological functions. That person could be a misguided ally. If they keep saying it even after you explained to them that they got it all wrong, they’re probably a troll trying to make trans people and their allies look insane and harmful. Warn others and then ignore them. “Trans people are not actually their gender identity because of different experiences.” . This includes all kinds of arguments about socialization and life experiences (e.g. mestruation). However, what is commonly forgotten is that cis people also have a wide range of experiences with gender and that there are multiple kinds of womanhood and manhood, both among cis and trans people: . | Some trans people are socialized as their gender identity if they socially transition early, others aren’t. Further, socialization continues throughout life, so even trans people who transitioned later will have different life experiences from cis people of their assigned gender. | Some cis people grow up with strong enforcement of gender roles, others with less. These differences also exist among trans people. | Some cis people grow up gnc as in relation to their assigned gender, others don’t. These differences also exist among trans people. | Some cis people grow up gay, others straight, others bi, ace, etc. These differences also exist among trans people. | Some cis and trans people are intersex, others are not. Further, there are a lot of different intersex variations and in cases of them being visible at birth, some intersex people are mutilated while others aren’t even noticed, etc. | . All kinds of different combinations and experiences of woman- and manhood arise out of this, and there is no objective scale of womenliness/manliness of those womanhoods and manhoods. Sure, a trans women may never experience menstruation and the stigma around it or give birth, but neither will many intersex cis women. Furthermore, the experience of cis women with severe cramps and irregular periods can’t be compared to cis women who can persistently take the pill to stop periods right after their first one in puberty for the rest of their lives. Yet nobody uses the lack of physical suffering of the latter group to invalidate their gender identity - why does this suddenly become a valid argument when used against trans women? And why aren’t the unique sufferings of trans womanhood (e.g. gender dysphoria, transmisogyny) acknowledged as qualifiers for womanhood as much as the sufferings unique to cis dyadic womanhood (e.g. giving birth, menstruation)? After all, only (even if only a part of) women can experience transmisogyny or gender dysphoria about the lack of breasts and hips. There is no rational reason for this differentiation, which makes it unjustly discriminating. Already addressed elsewhere . Here some links to other common myths and talking points spread by TERFs that have already been addressed elsewhere: . | ROGD/Transgender trend | “Transition harms people/is mutilation” | “Trans people are forcing you to date them” | “Sex cannot be significantly changed and is also a reason to not refer to a trans person by their gender identity” | Autogynephilia | .

    "content": "There is a narrative going around aimed at delegitimatizing the gender identities of trans youth, especially those AFAB. It usually ranges from the mere claim that trans identity is spreading socially and that such gender incongruence is less worthy of medical treatment and recognition, to the claim that big pharma controlled by Jews anti-white Muslims cultural Marxist college professors someone is luring our white fertile femoids baby-making machines daughters into sterilization medical transition to make the white race go extinct!!1 . The myth of social spread and Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) . This concept goes back to a study from 2018 by Lisa Littman. In this study, Littman collected a sample of parents with trans children from sites for those who don’t accept their children’s trans identities, because they already believe that there is a “transgender trend” (one of the sites is literally called “transgendertrend”) or similar theories. She then asked only the parents to describe the onset of their children’s gender dysphoria and they all had a recurring theme of an unexpected, sudden coming out as trans in adolescence, particularly among AFAB children. The parents also reported that teens often came out while spending a lot of time on social media or when others in their friend group also recently came out as trans. From this, Littman concluded that there is a phenomenon, especially among AFAB people in adolescence, that she called “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria” (ROGD). It is marked by a sudden, unexpected onset of gender dysphoria, that is spread socially (e.g. through social media). This study was then used by many people against trans youth (often also by parents against their own children) to claim that their gender dysphoria wasn’t “real” and caused socially, even though Littman implied only the latter and didn’t say or research anything on how persistent, “real”, and worthy of medical treatment ROGD is. Further, many people criticized the study due to multiple things: . | The measuring method: . | The study only asked clearly biased parents for their opinions as a measuring method. It didn’t even ask other people (such as doctors, other relatives, teachers) who have observed the child from a young age and aren’t recreuited from obviously anti-trans sites, hence who don’t have such an obvious bias as the parents do. Therefore we cannot even be sure if it is true that these teens had a sudden onset of gender dysphoria, or if they did show earlier signs and the parents are just denying this to validate their own preconceived notions. | The study didn’t ask the teens themselves. Even if all people who surrounded them from a young age were asked and agreed that there were no previous signs of gender dysphoria and the onset was sudden, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t there. Many people repress and hide their feelings from others pretty well - either because they are ashamed, don’t know what to do with these feelings, or even realize that they are indicative of something society considers inferior. | Even proponents of ROGD, who argue that being trans is now considered something “cool” in the West (which is also an incorrect claim), should agree that this only happened in recent years. Therefore it’s entirely possible that the teens of those parents simply didn’t know how to put their feelings into words during childhood, since the concept of trans people was unknown to them, and hid them instead (which is very unhealthy long-term). | . | . | It assumed that correlation equals causation. Even if the study used sound methodology, it is wrong to assume that just because there is a correlation between the use of social media and having trans friends and trans identity, that those things caused or even pressured the person into identifying as trans. Here are a few other (unless proven otherwise) equally possible explanations for these correlations: . | The onset of (acknowledging one’s) gender dysphoria is due to social acceptance by peers and social media. | The onset of (acknowledging one’s) gender dysphoria is due to finding out that trans people exist through social media or the coming out of others. | The onset of (acknowledging one’s) gender dysphoria is independent of age, social media, and peers. Sometimes gender dysphoria first appears in adolescence, and such cases of trans people have existed for basically since the beginning of medical recording. This is probably because adolescence is when AFAB and AMAB bodies start visibly sexually differentiating, which increases body-related gender dysphoria, and the first stage of major self-discovery in most people’s lives. | . | . Related to this is also the claim that Littman is being silenced or censored for revealing “the truth” about the evil trans agenda™, which can be quickly debunked by pointing out that the journal simply apologized for overlooking these issues during peer review and then republished her study with corrections and notes: Link to the statement (archive link) . “In discussion with those parties [2 academic editors and a statistics reviewer] we have reached the conclusion that the study and resultant data reported in the article represent a valid contribution to the scientific literature. However, we have also determined that the study, including its goals, methodology, and conclusions, were not adequately framed in the published version, and that these needed to be corrected. The changes include revisions of key sections such as title and abstract, which required us to republish the paper, allowing us to update the indexing of the article whilst preserving the original citation information.” . Here’s an excerpt from the revision written by Littman herself: . “This report did not collect data from the adolescents and young adults (AYAs) or clinicians and therefore does not validate the phenomenon. Additional research that includes AYAs, along with consensus among experts in the field, will be needed to determine if what is described here as rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) will become a formal diagnosis. Furthermore, the use of the term, rapid-onset gender dysphoria should be used cautiously by clinicians and parents to describe youth who appear to fall into this category. The term should not be used in a way to imply that it explains the experiences of all gender dysphoric youth nor should it be used to stigmatize vulnerable individuals.” . The myth of being pushed/rushed to medical transition and reduced diagnostic requirements . How to actually explain the sex ratio reversal . It is true that in recent years, the sex ratio of AFAB and AMAB trans teens reversed: While for most of recorded trans history there were more AMAB trans people, there are now more AFAB trans people among teens. But it would be wrong to conclude from this that the cause is social or a conspiracy by someone, and it is also very likely that this spike will soon end and the number of AFAB trans teens will stop at a certain level. Here are 2 alternative hypothesis’ to explain what is happening with the sex ratio in the West: . | There are naturally more AFAB trans people than AMAB trans people and previous records have been incorrect. They could have been wrong due to . | the measuring methods of that time: Studies trying to capture the sex ratio of trans people often used data from gender clinics of people who applied for certain surgeries. The same goes for current measuring methods that show the rise of AFAB trans teens. However, there are 2 problems here: . | To get surgery, a person has to be first taken seriously by a doctor, more specifically a psychiatrist, and have enough money to pay for it - both of which have been issues for people who are perceived as female by society, which includes pre-transition transmasculine people: Their opinions and experiences have been deligitimized even in the medical field and people who are perceived female are also paid less (even after adjusting for personal decisions like working part-time, taking more time off for childcare than men do) to this day, and that is despite massive progress. This could be why fewer transmasculine people managed to get to the point of surgery in the past, even if they wanted to, compared to transfeminine people, who are perceived as male and taken more seriously pre-transition. | It was easier and safer for a transmasculine person to not undergo medical transition and still pass as male in the past, which might have lead to less of a need to opt for it. But nowadays, as masculine-presenting women are becoming more common, transmasculine people need medical intervention to differentiate themselves from them more clearly and avoid gender dysphoria from being gendered female, which leads to more visits at the gender clinics. Only a few decades ago, a masculine haircut and binding your chest was enough for thin transmasculine people to more or less pass - but nowadays there’s plenty of women with small chests and short hair, which leads to these trans people being confused with them. | . | visibility: Trans women, even today, have much more (although mainly negative) visibility than non-binary AMAB people as well as all transmasculine identities. Many trans men might simply not have known that trans men or non-binary people even exist, not only trans women. But the small increase of transmasculine representation on platforms such as YouTube might have already been enough for such an increase. | reversed compulsory heterosexuality (short: comphet)(archive link) . | Comphet (archive link) itself is a concept primarily used to describe the experience of cis lesbians, but can also be used for the experiences of gay (androphilic) trans men and some transmasculine people, who we know from polls make up about as much or even more than heterosexual (gynephilic) trans men do. | Comphet teaches those who are being raised as female (including early socially transitioned trans girls) that womanhood is defined by attention and validation from men, which leads to many lesbians having trouble accepting or even recognizing their exclusive love for women. They were taught from a young age that they are only as much women as men validate them, and loving only women while wanting to retain womanhood is in direct conflict with this. | On the other hand, gay and bi trans men might have trouble letting go of womanhood and admitting they do not truly possess it, because they have been taught their entire lives that this is what gives them attention from men, which is what they want. But, as cis gay men are also increasingly accepted in the West (although there is still a long way to go), more trans gay men are able to recognize they do not need womanhood to be genuinely loved and desired by other men. | . | the negative attitudes to men in communities of queer women: Many straiht (gynephilic) and bi trans men first realize they feel attraction to women before they realize they are men, which leads to them spending a lot of time in spaces for lesbian and bi women. These communities are, as a reaction to the oppression by men, often very negative toward them and the idea of manhood in general. If a person then starts to realize they might actually be that man their friend group clearly doesn’t welcome a lot, they might instead - whether consciously or subconsciously - start repressing their gender incongruence. As trans people are becoming more accepted by cis people overall, this also includes many of these communities of queer women, leading to less self-repression. | Gender non-conformity is more accepted than being trans for both AFAB and AMAB people (archive link), but female masculinity is more accepted than male femininity (archive link), leading to more trans men than trans women coping through being cis gnc and not transitioning in the past: . | People who are seemingly female acting boyish (female masculinity) was more (even if by far not fully) accepted than being trans, which led to some transmasculine people living as gnc cis women as a coping mechanism, since the alternative - though more desirable - was more costly and less accepted. | Meanwhile, transfeminine people couldn’t do the same, because femininty practiced by someone who seems male (male femininity) is much more taboo than female masculinity. Because of this, trans women couldn’t cope with gender dysphoria simply by being gnc like some trans men could, and had to either stay masciline men or make the entire jump to transition and pass as female to avoid harassment. | Because being trans is in general being increasingly accepted and trans healthcare being more accessible, at least in parts of the West, less transmasculine people choose to settle for the coping mechanism of only being gnc and seek the treatment they actually need. | . | . | The sex ratio of trans people is roughly equal (this is also confirmed by various surveys, who are probably more accurate than looking at gender clinics) and AMAB trans people will eventually catch up. The reason why there is currently a spike of AFAB trans teens and no as high spike for AMAB teens is because transfemininity is frowned upon more than transmasculinity (archive link), which leads to more transfeminine than transmasculine people repressing their feelings overall. | . And the reason why a lot of young transmasculine people but much fewer older ones are coming out now is because . | older people use less social media (archive link) where the information leading to self-discovery is spread | young people have less to loose by transitioning, older transmasculine people might already be married to straight men or lesbian women, have family, a stable workplace, etc. | young people have less ingrained internalized transphobia and are better at admitting their true feelings because of that, while more older trans people who could realize they are trans now have already too strong negative attitudes against queer and specifically trans people to challenge them. | .
