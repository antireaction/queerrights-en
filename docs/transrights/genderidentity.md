## "Trans people are delusional."

I will use the word "delusion" to refer to a strong belief in something that is contrary to empirical evidence.
This claim usually comes from one of the following beliefs/assumptions:

1. That trans people claim they **are** the other sex when they clearly aren't, and that's delusional because it's denying their physiological reality.
2. That gender identity doesn't exist _at all_, so claiming that it is at odds with one's sex is delusional because it is claiming the existence of something (gender identity) that isn't there. Sex characteristics alone determine what you are.
3. That gender identity exists, but it can never be misaligned with one's sex characteristics and hence one's assigned sex, so claiming that there is a misalignment is delusional because such a misalignment is impossible. 

All of these are untrue.

### "Trans people claim they are a different sex."
Trans people are **not** claiming they **are** entirely the other sex physically, they are claiming they have a gender identity that tells them that they _ought_ to have different sex characteristics or perception of them by others _than they currently do (or used to have_ if they medically transitioned as far as they wish/as it is currently possible). This is what is called gender identity.

In fact, trans people live every single day of their lives with this reality. Trans people wouldn't even call themselves trans
if they thought they already were and always have been physically the sex they wish they were, they would call themselves cis people of their gender identity and nobody would be suffering from body-related gender dysphoria. The very definition
of "transgender" acknowledges the existence of sex characteristics and assigned sex.

Going up to a trans person and saying "but you're biologically still X" is rude not only because it's in most contexts
none of your concern and because it often causes unnecessary gender dysphoria, but also because it is condescending: You're assuming the person doesn't already know this and needs you to tell them that.

### "Gender identity doesn't exist."

[Work in progress]

#### Truthful until proven otherwise

Why would trans people want to lie to you about having gender dysphoria and/or euphoria like all of them are maliscious monsters? People should be assumed to be saying the truth about their own experiences unless proven otherwise by a more credible source, which - when it comes to feelings - doesn't really exist. Just like in court, where people are (or at least should be considered) innocent until proven otherwise, not the other way around.

The model/interpretation of those feelings that is most helpful and most in line with these experiences should be believed until there is a better one. The one asserting for there to be a gender identity which is subject to some but rarely/almost never full change and which can be seen as seperate from sexual orientation is currently the most helpful and congruent with many trans people's experiences.

### "Gender identity can't be misaligned with sex."
If trans people weren't truly one gender trapped in the body of another and their distress was due to something other than that, then it follows that medical and social transition - which aligns their gender identity with outer factors - 
[couldn't be as effective as it is at minimizing gender incongruence and the accompanying dysphoria](!!!). 

In fact, there should not only be no improvement if one's gender identity always aligned with one's sex characteristics - there
should be a worsening, because now it is being wrongly _misaligned_ while the actual cause of the distress still wasn't addressed. Yet this isn't what we see happening in reality, so this theory must be false based on empirical data.

### Recognition by institutions

---

## "Being trans is like X bad thing"

### "Claiming to be a different gender than assigned is like claiming to be a different age, species, or ethnicity." (slippery slope argument)

### "Wanting to modify perfectly healthy sex characteristics is like wanting to cut off healthy limbs (and should be forbidden)" (comparison to body integrity identity disorder)

---

## "Trans people are mentally ill."


---

## "Gender identity can be changed." (advocacy for conversion therapy)

---

## Myths about the causes of gender incongruence

### "Trans women are actually men with autogynephilia." or "It's a fetish."

### "Gender dysphoria is caused by autism."

### "Gender dysphoria is caused by/is the same as body dimorphism, eating disorders, or self-hate."
