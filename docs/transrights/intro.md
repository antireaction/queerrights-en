**Note**: Terminology for trans topics varies wildly. There are plenty of websites, organizations, people, and scientific studies who use words slightly if not completely differently than this site does, so make sure you understand how others use terms when you interpret their studies, articles, etc.

There are also theorists (who are trans-affirming) who question fundamental concepts presented here (such as the cis-trans dichotomy or exact seperation of gender identity and expression) altogether. For the sake of simplicity (and because this is a site created for making pragmatic points and not philosophical  discussions for their own sake), I decided to stay away from mentionng such nuances further in this introduction unless they significantly impact policies.
I will explain here what I believe is the most practical and mostly accepted (or at least not heavily controversial) framework for understanding these topics among trans people themselves, even though I agree with some criticisms made against it (I will maybe add a page discussing those in the future when the rest of the site is finished).

Just know that models, in general, are never identical to reality and only attempt to come close to putting it in words to understand certain aspects of it. The model presented here is no exception from this.

### Basics - gender identity, assigned sex

**Transgender people** (or short "trans people") are people whose gender identity does not align with the sex (and consequently gender) they were assigned at birth at all times and to full degree. The opposite is **cisgender** or cis: The full and constant alignment of one's gender identity with the assigned sex and gender.
- If you're thinking "Why do we need a word for cis people? Can't we just call them normal?" - it's the same reason why you don't say "black and normal people". 
It implies the other one is not normal, and "not normal" does not have just the statistical meaning of "not in the majority". It is often used in a judging or degrading way, e.g. as "sick", "immoral", etc. Furthermore, "normal", even in the statistical sense, can change depending on context - calling cis people "normal" while in a friend group of mostly trans people just seems odd and confusing. "Cis" is 1. specfic and devoid of confusion in all contexts, 2. does not stigmatize it's opposite.

All people - whether cis or trans - should (as far as it is possible and safe) be gendered according to their gender identities, because it reduces unnecessary 
and unproductive distress for the addressed person and is therefore the most respectful and humane option.

Additionally, in those cases where the person is also living and looks in accordance with their gender identity, it would just be unnecessarily confusing for everyone to call them something else just because they used to look like something else. It'd be like calling a butterfly a caterpillar.

- **Trans men** are people who were assigned female at birth (**AFAB**) but have a male gender identity. 
	- **Transmasculine** is a broader term that includes anyone who was AFAB, but has no female (or not exclusively female) gender identity, including non-binary people.
	- "**FtM**" is an acronym that stands for "female-to-male" and is often used as a synonym for trans men, more rarely for all transmasculine people.
	It's often used in scientific studies. In the community, there are people who dislike the term because it mentions their assigned gender, but also people who are proud of it because it mentions the often hard journey they had to go through to arrive where they are.
- **Trans women**, **transfeminine** people, and "**MtF**"s (male-to-female) are the corresponding terms for those who were assigned male at birth (**AMAB**).
- **Non-binary** people are people of any assigned sex who have a gender identity that is **not always or exclusively male or female** - 
for example it could be inbetween (neutrois), fluctuating (genderfluid), absent (agender, genderless), a combination of them (multigender), etc. 
Many non-binary people use singular they/them pronouns in English, so it is usually a more or less safe bet to refer to them as such. Some also use neopronouns (e.g. ze/zir).
	- They might use acronyms like "**FtX**", "**FtN**" (female-to-X, female-to-neutral) or "**MtX**", "**MtN**" (male-to-X, male-to-neutral).

**Gender identity** is an internal sense of what one's sex characteristics are _ought_ (supposed) to be like (bodily aspect, "sex identity") and/or be referred to as (social aspect).

- Gender identity is **not chosen** for anyone, neither cis nor trans people. What one chooses is how one puts it into words, but the feelings (explained further down) being interpreted for that, are not under anyone's full control.

- Gender identity is **not** what **gendered expectations or roles** one fits better, and being trans is not just disliking one's assigned gender role.

- Gender identity is **not voluntary gender expression** (how a person chooses to dress, cut their hair, etc. - not including sex characteristics because 
nobody chooses them voluntarily, although they can be considered as part of _general_ gender expression). 
While voluntary gender expression is often one that aligns with a given society's expectations for one's gender identity, it doesn't have to be and is not what determines 
a person's gender identity.
	- Having a voluntary gender expression that does not correspond with societal expectations for one's gender identity is called **gender non-conformity (gnc)**. 
	Both cis and trans people can be gnc. **Gnc is not the same as non-binary or trans**, the former is about expression and the latter about identity. 
		- Many organizations will define being trans as having an identity _or expression_ that doesn't match one's assigned sex, 
		but I'm guessing they are including sex characteristics as part of gender expression and hence gender non-conformity would also include having 			atypical (even not chosen) sex characteristics.
		Since this site, and as far as I know a majority of trans people themselves, define gnc differently (not referring to not chosen sex 				characteristics), 
		gnc will not be included as being trans here.
		- **Crossdressing** (formerly also called "transvestism") is an "extreme" form of gnc and are often confused with trans people. 
		However, crossdressers differ fundamentally from trans people of the same assigned sex in that crossdressers change their appearance for entertainment 
		(e.g. drag/caricaturing, acting), and in some cases sexual desires, while trans people do so for authenticity (the very opposite of acting).

- Being trans is **not connected to sexual orientation**, it isn't just being "really really gay" or similar. Trans people can have any sexual orientation, 
including gay/lesbian, bi, ace, or straight (from the perspective of their gender identity, e.g. a gay trans man is attracted to other men). 
Gender identity is about what gender(s) you **are**, orientation is what gender(s) you are capable of falling in **love** with.

- Gender identity is **not** necessarily always what gender one is perceived by others - or in other words **passes** - as. Sometimes people cannot live out their 
gender identity due to various circumstances, like stigma around being trans, and even when they can they might not always pass as the gender they're trying to live as. 
I will refer to the gender a given person is actually perceived as by others and living as as their **perceived/lived gender**.

In many trans circles people will often say "gender" to mean specifically "gender _identity_".
I won't be doing that here to make absolutely sure there is no confusion about what aspect of "gender" (identity, expression, perceived/lived, expectations) is meant.

> **Note**: It's true that trans people often look like cis gnc people or even experiment with crossdressing before they realize they're trans and/or let you know.
But please do not pressure a seemingly cis gnc person you know to tell you whether they are trans or not.

>If they are they would tell you when they feel ready, don't put them on the spot or put pressure on them.
And if they aren't trans, the question just becomes meaningless in the first place.
The majority of people who are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender are not trans, and not all trans people are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender before they come out.

>If you see a gnc cis person and worry that they are actually trans, but just haven't realized yet because they don't know trans people exist: Casually bring up the topic of trans 
people and the possibilities of transition without making any connections or references to them personally. This
way you can be sure they know trans people and the option to transition exists without putting them on the spot.

- **Assigned sex/gender at birth** is what sex a person is assumed to be at birth, usually based on their genitals, and what gender identity they are expected to develop based on that. 
This doesn't always correspond to a person's actual natal sex, as it is the case with [intersex people](!!!), whose genitals might a) be ambiguous or b) not be indicative of their 
entire sex anatomy.
- **Sex** (as a biological trait) has 2 common definitions: 
	- **(a)** _(strictly biological)_ What **gametes** are produced/mature in a given organism (big = female, small = male); 
	- **(b)** _(more common when referring to humans)_ The **sum of** an organisms **sex characteristics** (e.g. sex chromosomes, gamete sex, reproductive organs/internal genitalia, 
	external genitalia, secondary sex characteristics (e.g. breasts, beard, voice pitch))

### Figuring out - gender dysphoria & euphoria

The way one figures out whether they are trans is by not being able to recognize one's body's gendered traits and/or gendered words, pronouns, names, etc. directed at oneself (incongruence).
- Often this incongruence of sex characteristics and/or their perception by society causes distress (gender dysphoria), and relieving this conflict causes joy or relief (gender euphoria). 
- All of these feelings are ideally alleviated through transition and are therefore not inherent or the defining trait of being trans. They are, however, the currently only way of 
deducting one's gender identity.
- Since cis people can sometimes feel them too if put in situations that invalidate their gender identities, we can conclude that everyone has a gender identity. 
The reason why many cis people say they don't "feel" like a gender and are confused about what the hell trans people are talking about is 
because **gender**, for most people, **is like a bone - you only feel it when it's broken.**
- However, among cis as well as trans people, there can be genuine variance in how strong a person's gender identity is. Hence some people have stronger gender dysphoria/euphoria than others,
some even call themselves gender-apathetic or are entirely genderless and are therefore incapable of ever feeling gender dysphoria.

A person can figure out they are trans at any age and under all kinds of circumstances. For example, they might have previously repressed themselves from months to 
entire decades and maybe even tried to compensate/push their feelings away even more by being a stereotype of their assigned gender, which might make a coming out as trans unexpected. 
This doesn't make their gender identity any less real. 
Childhood experiences or the genders of their friend group also don't have to be indicative of the validity of a trans 
person's identity - plenty of cis people grow up gnc and have mostly friends of the other assigned gender, but nobody (and rightfully so) insists they must be trans based on merely this, 
hence nobody should insist a trans person has to be cis just because they didn't show those "signs" in childhood.

The psychological diagnosis of gender incongruence is usually needed for medical transition. It includes both gender dysphoria and euphoria. 
Formerly it was also called "transsexualism", "gender identity disorder", and "gender dysphoria", which have all been given up due to being stigmatizing.

### Transition - social, legal, medical

Trans people usually aim for **transition** to align their **lived/perceived gender** (what gender one lives as; is perceived as by others/**passes** as) with their gender identity. 
Transition means aligning one's 
- **social life** (e.g. name, pronouns, usually involves coming out)
- **legal documents** (gender marker, legal name) and/or
- sex characteristics as far as it is **medically** possible 

...with one's gender identity. These are called social, legal, and medical transition respectively. Everyone's transition looks differently, because different trans people will have different needs, just like cis people differ in their bodies, understandings of gender, and expression too.

- Medical transition can include **hormone replacement therapy (HRT)** (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone-blockers for transfeminine people - testosterone, rarely estrogen-blockers for transmasculine people)
 and **sex reassignment surgeries (SRS)** (yes, plural - "_the_ surgery" is a myth and there's actually a lot of them). SRS is usually irreversible, HRT has some reversible and some 
 irreversible effects.
	- Adolescents under the age of 16 are only ever given **hormone blockers** and only with parental consent and psychological recommendation. 
	Hormone blockers are almost entirely reversible and in the vast majority of cases (when there's no allergic reaction) cause no harm if taken according to instructions. They simply offset natal puberty as long as the blockers are 
	taken and are regularly used for cis children whose puberty is starting dangerously early as well.
- Hormones change a majority of visible sex characteristics, ranging from fat distribution to skin texture, and surgeries remove the rest of the remaining visible sex characteristics of one's assigned sex as needed (e.g. breasts, facial hair), or can enhance those of one's desired sex (e.g. breast augmentation, genital surgeries).

People who have taken any steps toward transition (whether social, legal, or medical) and later went back some or all steps to their assigned gender are called **detransitioners**. 
This term includes
- people who were entirely mistaken about being trans and are technically cis.
- people who realized they are non-binary rather than binary trans.
- people who detransitioned due to social, religious, reproductive, or financial issues and might **retransition** later.

Sometimes those detransitioners who only transitioned socially are called **desisters**.

### Purpose of the site

The purpose of this section of the site is to provide evidence for the validity of this narrative and debunking misconceptions and opposing anti-trans narratives, 
such as those fearmongering about the dangers of "gender ideology" that is supposedly "denying biological reality" and "luring" confused teenage girls into a "transgender cult" while
at the same time threatening the "sex-based rights" of (cis, [episex](! "not intersex")) women.
