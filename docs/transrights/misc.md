## LGB without the T

A small group of LGB people oppose being grouped with trans people into once movement. 

A part of them thinks so because they think that being trans is homophobic because it's either

- a) making gay/lesbian cis people straight as the other binary gender by "transing" them or 
- b) forcing cis gay/lesbian people to be straight by dating trans people.

The latter comes from the false belief that trans people are forcing anyone to date them and that trans people are not really their gender identity or that this gender identity is irrelevant to attraction and only chromosomes and reproductive organs (which cannot be currently changed) matter (which is also untrue, as visible sex characteristics are more influential for most people's attractions - a man dating a (female-presenting) trans woman is not gay, and therefore a man dating a (male-presenting) trans man is not straight).

But another part of those people simply think that gay/lesbian/bi people face too different issues to be grouped with trans people, which is what will be addressed here.
1. Most trans people are gay/lesbian or bi, so even if you included only LGB people, a majority of trans people would still be included. It doesn't make much sense to throw such a fit as people advocating for a split usually do over literally less than a fourth of trans people who are straight and would be excluded through such a split.
2. Arguments against gay/lesbian and trans people are literally the same, just rephrased a bit - yes, all of them. And therfore LGB and T people should stick together in fighting them, because their nature/basic thought process is the exact same. They all stem from the same reactionary attitude. Take a look at this table:

| Argument/Occurance     | Against homosexuality| Against transness    |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------------------|
|appeal to nature | "Homosexuality is unnatural" | "Being trans is unnatural" |
|illness | "Being gay is a mental illness." | "Being trans is a mental illness."|
|traumatic origin | "Being gay is caused by childhood sexual trauma/issues with society's expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc." | "Being trans is caused by sexual trauma/issues with society's expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc."|
|the agenda | "The gay agenda is to make all our kids gay!"| "The trans agenda is to make all our kids trans!" - e.g. ROGD |
|the agenda but it's even more evil | (Related to the traumatic origin argument) "Gay recruiters target especially vulnerable, traumatized/unstable/autistic/supposedly unable to think for themselves people to lure in." | "The trans agenda especially preys on autistic cis girls/gay cis boys/butch lesbians/etc. to convince them they're trans." |
|physical harm | "Homosexuality is harmful - look at all the AIDs, the gay bowel syndrome, anal sex causing incontinence, etc." | "Being trans is harmful - those hormones cause cancers and heart disease, the surgeries leave phantom sensations, etc."|
|curability | "Lesbians are only lesbian because they never had a good dick.", "Gay men just need to find a good girl to settle down with." | "Trans people just need to be reminded of their biology by reproducing." or "Trans people just have to be forced to live as a stereotype of their assigned gender long enough to really see how great it is, then they'll become cis."|
|movement of the "cured" | The ex-gay movement - Often got over-proportional and misrepresenting attention, making it seems like a much more viable and universal "solution" (of something that doesn't need to be "solved") - or solution at all - than it is. | Detransitioners who specifically blame their or their doctors' mistakes on trans people as a whole and get over-proportional attention (especially widespread in Great Britain right now), making it seem like detransition is much more common than it really is. |
|lifstyle choice| "Being gay is a lifestyle choice." | "Being trans is a lifestyle choice." |
|failure | "Gay men/lesbian women are just failed/ugly/too effamite/too masculine men/women who couldn't get a girl/guy." | "Trans people are too ugly as their assigned gender so they turn to transition." or "Trans people just can't come to terms with being gender non-conforming as their assigned gender." or "Trans people are just gays/lesbians who couldn't get a guy/girl/suffer from internalized homophobia."|
|attention-seeking and trendiness| "Gay/lesbian/bi people just want attention, they don't have a real personality, so they're hopping onto a trend to feel special."|"Trans people just want attention, they have no real personality, so they're hopping onto a trend to feel special." |
|don't shove it in my face | "I'm fine with gay people, as long as they don't shove it in my face." (read: as long as they don't publicly exist at all and never hold hands in public, never kiss in public, never appear in any media, never go on a date in public - like straight people do, oh, you know, only _literally all the time_ without a second glance from anyone) |"I'm fine with trans people as long as they don't shove it in my face" - and then in the same breath they will rant about trans people having to disclose their identity to everyone or it's basically assault (see the next point). |
|tell everyone | "Gay/lesbian people are immoral if they don't let everyone know they're gay/lesbian to avoid an employer hiring them even though they disagree with 'their lifestyle'/letting down a straight person who might fall in love with them/." (admittedly has always been a rather rare rhetoric, but still, it did and does exist if you dig deep enough in homophobic circles)| "Trans people are immoral if they don't tell everyone they are trans, otherwise they are luring in and lying to people ~~and it's justified if they get murdered for it~~."|
|don't hit on me | "Yeah I'm fine that you're gay, just don't hit on me." | "Yeah I'm fine that you're trans, but I won't sleep with you." |
|slippery slope | "If we accept homosexuality, what will come next? Accepting zoophilia, pedophilia, going around naked outside? Society will degregate!" | "If we accept transgender people, what will come next? Accepting transspecies (~zoophilia), transethnicity, transage (~pedophilia)? I identify as a penguin!"|
|appeal to religion | "God said homosexuality is a sin" | "Rejecting god's creation is a sin" |
|god makes no mistakes | "God made so that male and female are complementary in their anatomy, he made us to be heterosexual physically and everyone has to follow that. He doesn't make mistakes."|"God can't accidentally put a female/male/ambiguous soul in a male/female(/ambiguous, although the demographic of people making this argument is, I assume, unlikely to acknowledge intersex people) body, he doesn't make mistakes."|

The lack of creativity of bigots is impressive.

## TERFs

### What is a "TERF" and is it a slur?

---
### "Terms like "menstruator" are dehumanizing because I am more than my reproductive organs. I should be allowed to call myself a woman."

_*the entire trans community nods in agreement*_

Terms like "menstruator" are made exactly to **not** be used as a synonym for "woman". They are meant to simply be more percise when talking about biological functions, by saying "menstruator" or "people who menstruate" you are shwoing that
1. it's not just women who menstruate (e.g. girls and _some_ trans people do too even though many of them are deeply uncomfortable with that) and 
2. not all women menstruate (e.g. post-menopausal women, intersex women, women who had hysterectomy, some women who are permanently on birth control, trans women) and that womanhood is not defined by this biological function. In fact, in sum
[about half of the female population in the UK doesn't menstruate](https://www.menstrual-matters.com/maths-people/) [(archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112447/https://www.menstrual-matters.com/maths-people/).

The same goes for terms like "people with prostate" etc. If someone tried to force you stop using the word "woman" in the name of trans rights, tell them they're harming trans people with this since trans people want the exact opposite
of equating gender and biological functions. That person could be a misguided ally.

If they keep saying it, even after you explained to them that they got it all wrong,
they're probably a troll trying to make trans people and their allies look insane and harmful. Warn others and then ignore them.

### "Trans people are not actually their gender identity because of different experiences."

This includes all kinds of arguments about socialization and life experiences (e.g. mestruation). However, what is commonly forgotten is that cis people also have a wide range of experiences with gender and that there are multiple
kinds of womanhood and manhood, both among cis and trans people:
- Some trans people are socialized as their gender identity if they socially transition early, others aren't. Further, socialization continues throughout life, so even trans people who transitioned later will have different life experiences from
cis people of their assigned gender.
- Some cis people grow up with strong enforcement of gender roles, others with less. These differences also exist among trans people.
- Some cis people grow up gnc as in relation to their assigned gender, others don't. These differences also exist among trans people.
- Some cis people grow up gay, others straight, others bi, ace, etc. These differences also exist among trans people.
- Some cis and trans people are intersex, others are not. Further, there are a lot of different intersex variations and in cases of them being visible at birth, some intersex people are mutilated while others aren't even noticed, etc. 

All kinds of different combinations and experiences of woman- and manhood arise out of this, and there is no objective scale of womenliness/manliness of those womanhoods and manhoods.

Sure, a trans women may never experience menstruation and the stigma around it or give birth, but neither will many intersex cis women. Furthermore, the experience of cis women with severe cramps and irregular periods can't be compared to
cis women who can persistently take the pill to stop periods right after their first one in puberty for the rest of their lives without noticable side effects.
Yet nobody uses the lack of physical suffering of the latter group to invalidate their gender identity -
why does this suddenly become a valid argument when used against trans women?

And why aren't the unique sufferings of trans womanhood (e.g. gender dysphoria, transmisogyny) acknowledged as qualifiers for 
womanhood as much as the sufferings unique to cis [endosex](! "not intersex") womanhood (e.g. giving birth, menstruation)? 
After all, it is typically (even if only a part of) women (and some non-binary people) can experience transmisogyny or gender dysphoria about the lack of breasts and hips.

Trans people's lives before social transition (if it occurs at all) is still very different from that of cis people of their assigned gender, because the former
is living in a closeted, repressed, inauthentic and thereby less productive and satisfying state. You wouldn't say that a gay person who was always 
straight-passing lived in the closet for longer is not truly gay because they weren't seen as gay from childhood on, because homophobia still 
affected them in indirect ways (e.g. through witnessing and internalization). You would be correct to point out, that their experience is different from someone,
who was bullied since elementary school, but that's a diffrent claim from the idea that they are the only true experience through which one becomes a gay person.
Similarly, you are correct to point out that trans people tend to have different experiences with their gender, than cis people of their gender identity - but
their experiences are also different from cis people of their assigned gender, and all this is not enough of an argument against still recognizing them (socially,
culturally, politically,...) as the gender of their gender identity.
