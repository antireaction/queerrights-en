| [Eldh et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.3109/02844319709010503) | Swedish clinical sample of 40 trans men and 50 trans women | questionnaires before and 6 months to 30 years (median 5,8 years) after SRS including bottom surgery; comparison of before & after responses | 86,5% (64/74) of respondents satisfied with their lives post-SRS; 5,4% (2 people of each gender) detransitioned socially and regretted the surgeries; 4% (2 trans women and 1 trans man) commited suicide, but had many suicide attempts before SRS as well; social stability (e.g. acceptance by family & friends), surgical techniques and overall body appearance (beside genitals) were found to be predictors of good outcomes |  |
| [Landen et al. (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1998.tb10001.x) | Swedish clinical sample undergoing initial SRS from 1972-1992; 213 total | retrospective study of medical records, looked for predictors of regret after SRS (including bottom surgery) | 8 detransitioners (3,8%) in total; mostly associated with poor family support and less frequently with not being a "core transsexual" or having psychosis; last year in which someone who later requested reversal received approval for SRS was 1982 | time between SRS and request for reversal 1-15 years (7,4 years median), meaning that some of the more recent patients considered non-regretful here could technically have eventually requested reversal years after the study was conducted |
| [Rehman et al. (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1018745706354) * | American clinical sample of 28 trans women | interviews 3 years after SRS | no regrets, ability to normally return to work, more satisfactory personal and social life of patients after SRS |  |

| [Smith et al. (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15842032) * | Dutch clinical sample of 94 trans women and 64 trans men | questionnaires and personal interview (not all participants completed the latter) 1-4 years after SRS | **virtually no gender dysphoria after SRS, independent of "subtype"**; no body dissatisfaction, 91,6% were even _very_ satisifed with their bodies; better psychological functioning; 1 trans woman had strong regrets and would not choose SRS again (it is not stated that they detransitioned though), another had strong regrets but would choose to undergo it again | almost all patients in this sample had social support, only 4 (3,9%) had absolutely nobody to rely on |

| [Kraemer et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18033979) | Swiss clinical sample of 16 trans women and 7 trans men pre-SRS, 14 trans women and 8 trans men post-SRS | compared questionnaire responses of pre- and post-SRS people; post-SRS group had 5 months to 8 years (median of 51 months=4,25 years) follow-up | post-SRS sample scored significantly higher in measures of self-confidence and attractiveness and lower on insecurity and concern compared to pre-SRS sample; none of the tested variables were found to be correlated to the time since SRS; taking HRT or not in the pre-SRS group was not found to be correlated to any of the tested variables either |  |

(2011)](doi.org/10.7870/cjcmh-2011-0021) ** | Canadian sample of 205 trans men recruited through the internet, organizations, venues, etc. | survey on factors associated with depression; comparison of trans men with or without treatment | depression was associated with (among other things) not taking HRT as well as planning to medically transition but not currently doing so; less depression was associated with having medically transitioned and having had surgery before 2008 (which was defined as not recent) | non-clinical sample  |
| [Gomez-Gil et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.08.010) | Spanish clinical sample of 113 trans women and 74 trans men | questionnaires on the effects of HRT and SRS; comparison of trans people with or without HRT and/or SRS | both SRS and HRT significantly correlated with reduced depression, anxiety, and social distress |  |

| [Colizzi et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12155) | Italian clinical sample of 45 trans women and 25 trans men | questionnaires & blood test before and 12 months into HRT; tested stress, attachment patterns, and cortisol awakening response (CAR) | HRT decreased CAR levels and perceived stress regardless of attachment style | excluded intersex people and people with psychiatric pathologies from the beginning |

| [Gomez-Gil et al.
