## Medical transition

### "Medical transition does not alleviate gender dysphoria or improve psychological functioning."

Related claim: "Everyone/the majority regrets medical transition and detransitions."
[Work in progress]

#### "Cross-sex HRT is dangerous/physically harmful"

[Work in progress]

#### "Sex reassignment surgeries are experimental/too dangerous/understudied"

[Work in progress]

#### "Sex reassignment surgeries are mutilation"

According to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/body-modifications-and-mutilations) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513121958/https://www.britannica.com/science/body-modifications-and-mutilations)), the term "body mutilation" is typically used to refer to involuntary body modifications. [Wikipedia adds, at least for genital mutilation specifically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification#Controversy):

> The phrase "Genital mutilation" is sometimes used to describe procedures that individuals are forced to undergo without their informed consent, or **without anesthesia or sterilised surgical tools.**

But consensual modifications - ranging from tattoos to heart surgeries - are usually considered just that, modifications. Wikipedia differentiates further as follows:

> In many ways self-mutilation is very different than body-modification. Body modification gives one the feeling of pride and excitement, giving one something to show off to others. Alternately, those who self-mutilate typically are ashamed of what they've done and want to hide any evidence of harm. Body modification is explored for adornment, self-expression, and an array of many other positive reasons, while self-mutilation is inflicted because of mental or emotional stress and the inability to cope with psychological pain. Those who self-mutilate do so in order to punish themselves, express internal turmoil, and reduce severe anxiety.

Medical transition clearly falls under the term of body modification, rather than mutilation:
1. In the case of trans people, it is only performed with informed consent.
2. It is usually performed in safe, sterile environments, depending on the procedure with anesthesia, and proper tools by professionals.
3. It is performed not as punishmet, but as self-expression. 
	- While it does sometimes alleviate anxiety that might accompany gender dysphoria for some people, this is by far not always the case, as many trans people do not suffer from anxiety pre-transition. Even when they do: Medical transition tries to reduce anxiety constructively and long-term and not just in the moment, with no thinking through, like self-harm does. 
	- Scars from surgeries are sometimes shown off too, and when they aren't, it's because the indvidual wishes they naturally appeared the way they do after surgery, and not because they regret or are ashamed having had the procedure in the first place.
4. Medical transition does not simply rid a person's body of certain functions/impair them, but can also add new ones (e.g. metoidioplasty giving people the ability to have natural, visible erections) or only removes abilities that the person sees as limiting/impairing in the first place (e.g. removal of reproductive organs of the assigned sex). SRS is not destructive, but reconstructive.

Calling it mutilation despite all of this - but not other helpful, consensual medical procedures - is wrongly stigmatizing. It makes it sound as if someone was going around and forcing trans people to undergo unsafe surgeries which leave them more disabled and unhappy than before, which is not the case for informed medical transition.

Who some of this does happen to, however, are certain [intersex minors](!!!), even when the procedure is not medically necessary/life-saving and has purely aesthetic goals. Ironically, the types of people who decry medical transition as mutilation tend to not care about the forced re-assignment of intersex infants or even promote this harmful practice. 

An example of this is the [Arksansas House Bill 1570](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513182601/https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf)), also ironically called "Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act" (SAFE Act), which bans all gender-affirming medical care to trans youth as being dangerous and experimental, but _explicitly_ allows practitioners to re-assign intersex minors (even when their life is not endangered by being intersex). From pages 6 and 7 of the bill:

> "[...] (B)  “Gender transition procedures” do not include:
> 		(i)  Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development [=intersex traits], including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, such as those born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular tissue;
> 		(ii)  Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action; [...]
> 		(iv)  Any procedure undertaken because the individual suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major bodily function unless surgery is performed;

Point (iv) makes clear that point (i) and (ii) serve to allow intersex re-assignment _even when leaving things as they are doesn't place them in imminent danger_, because those cases where they do pose a danger are already included in point (iv). Therefore point (i) and (ii) would be redundant if they _only_ referred to intersex children whose health is in danger without intervention.

It shows that many of the people insisting on using the term "mutilation" or "experimental" for medical transition are not genuinely concerned about bodily autonomy or safety, because if they were, they would care and talk much more about the proven harm of intersex re-assignments that routinely happen in the majority of countries.

## Biology

### "Trans people will biologically always remain their natal sex."
