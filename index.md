# About
{: .no_toc }
## This is a static site with the goal to debunk myths, fearmongering, and pseudoscience about queer people.
{: .no_toc }

By queer people I mean all people who this word has been and sometimes still is used as an insult against, as well as people who are commonly lumped in 
together with them and also face similar issues due to cisheteronormativity, such as:
* Gay and lesbian people
* Bi (including pan, omni, and poly) people
* Transgender (including non-binary) people
* Asexual and aromantic people, who share with gay and lesbian people their lack of attraction to the other binary gender, issues of erasure and invisibility with bi people, 
and issues of alienation from straight mainstream society due to allonormativity.
* Intersex people, who share with trans people that their bodies are shamed and fetishized for not fitting expectations of typical male and female bodies, but are additionally often
mutilated or overlooked.

The same group of people is also described as LGBT+ or other derivatives of it, but I decided against it as it commonly leads to either exclusionism or the acronym getting endlessly long.
"Queer" may have a history of being used as a slur against LGBT+ people, but it's the most frequently preferred and the third most accepted according to [this survey](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/173556136743/what-is-the-ranking-of-various-acronyms-for-the)
 [(archive link)](). Those who don't prefer this term [tend to be - among other factors - exclusionists](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/172970586838/how-do-different-identities-accept-and-reject-the) [(archive link)]().
 
This is not to say that anyone who uses the term LGBT+ is an exclusionist, as plenty of non-exclusionist people use it (including me), alongside other terms. I'm just proving my point about the downsides of LGBT+ acronyms making exclusionism easier.

## Site structure 

I structured this site by dividing various groups into their own main sections (e.g. "Trans Rights!") and then the direct replies to certain myths being categorized vaguely 
by what they're about.
If you can't seem to find a certain myth being addressed through these categories, try searching keywords in the search bar. 
If you still can't find it, but think it is an important myth to be addressed here, you can write me.

## Sources

All sources are linked and there's always an archive link additionally to them in case something happens to the website (e.g. the information on it gets changed or it goes down).

The following resources greatly helped me with adding more sources for the counter-arguments and also made me aware of some reactionary arguments I hadn't encountered before:
