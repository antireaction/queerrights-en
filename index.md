# About
{: .no_toc }
## This is a static site with the goal to debunk myths, fearmongering, and pseudoscience about queer people.
{: .no_toc }

By queer people I mean all people who due to their sex characteristics or harmless attraction(s) are not considered typical (hence "queer") by today's society, including:
* Gay and lesbian people
* Bi (including pan, omni, and poly) people
* Transgender (including non-binary) people
* Asexual and aromantic people
* Intersex people

The same group of people is also described as LGBT+ or other derivatives of it, but I decided against it as it commonly leads to either exclusionism or the acronym getting endlessly long.
"Queer" may have a history of being used as a slur against LGBT+ people, but it's the most frequently preferred and the third most accepted according to [this survey](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/173556136743/what-is-the-ranking-of-various-acronyms-for-the)
 [(archive link)](). Those who don't prefer this term [tend to be - among other factors - exclusionists](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/172970586838/how-do-different-identities-accept-and-reject-the) [(archive link)]().
 
This is not to say that anyone who uses the term LGBT+ is an exclusionist, as plenty of non-exclusionist people use it (including me), alongside other terms. I'm just proving my point about the downsides of LGBT+ acronyms giving exclusionists a rhetorical ammunition.

## Site structure 

I structured this site by dividing various groups into their own main sections (e.g. "Trans Rights!") and then the direct replies to certain myths being categorized vaguely 
by what they're about.
If you can't seem to find a certain myth being addressed through these categories, try searching keywords in the search bar. 
If you still can't find it, but think it is an important myth to be addressed here, you can write me.

## Sources

All sources are linked and there's always an archive link additionally to them in case something happens to the website (e.g. the information on it gets changed or it goes down).

The following resources greatly helped me with adding more sources for the counter-arguments and also made me aware of some reactionary arguments I hadn't encountered before:
- [The Trans Rights Factsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Le70f0hs5ZDSGlP13YQaa5k_YjD27VaxOHB9g1J0X6g/mobilebasic) by Pearl (@PearloLesbo on Twitter), NB419 (u/NB419 on Reddit), and Apa/Scuter (u/Apatheizer on Reddit and Scuter on YouTube)

## Other languages

I plan on translating this site into German and Russian once I finish the English version.
